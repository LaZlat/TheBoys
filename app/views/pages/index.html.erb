         <p class="lead">The Boys is an American superhero streaming television series developed by Eric Kripke for
             Prime Video.</p>
         <p>The Boys is set in a universe where superpowered individuals are recognized as heroes by the general public
             and work for the powerful corporation Vought International, which markets and monetizes them. Outside of
             their heroic personas, most are arrogant and corrupt. The series primarily focuses on two groups: the
             Seven, Vought's premier superhero team, and the eponymous Boys, vigilantes looking to bring down Vought and
             its corrupt superheroes. </p>

         <p>The Boys are led by Billy Butcher, who despises all superpowered people, and the Seven are led by the
             narcissistic and violent Homelander. At the start of the series, the Boys are joined by Hughie Campbell
             after a member of the Seven accidentally kills his girlfriend, while the Seven are joined by Annie January,
             a young and hopeful heroine forced to face the truth about those she admires. Other members of the Seven
             include the disillusioned Queen Maeve, drug-addicted A-Train, insecure the Deep, the mysterious Black Noir,
             and white supremacist Stormfront. The Boys are rounded out by tactical planner Mother's Milk, weapons
             specialist Frenchie, and superpowered test subject Kimiko. Overseeing the Seven is Vought executive Madelyn
             Stillwell, who is later succeeded by publicist Ashley Barrett. </p>
